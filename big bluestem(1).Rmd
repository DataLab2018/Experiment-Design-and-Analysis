## A real world study
We wish to study the competition of grass species: in particular, big
bluestem (from the tall grass prairie) versus quack grass (a weed). We set
up an experimental garden with 24 plots. These plots were randomly allocated
to the six treatments: nitrogen level 1 (200 mg N/kg soil) and no
irrigation; nitrogen level 1 and 1cm/week irrigation; nitrogen level 2 (400
mg N/kg soil) and no irrigation; nitrogen level 3 (600 mg N/kg soil) no irrigation;
nitrogen level 4 (800 mg N/kg soil) and no irrigation; and nitrogen
level 4 and 1 cm/week irrigation. Big bluestem was seeded in these plots
and allowed to establish itself. After one year, we added a measured amount
of quack grass seed to each plot. After another year, we harvest the grass
and measure the fraction of living material in each plot that is big bluestem.
We wish to determine the effects (if any) of nitrogen and/or irrigation on the
ability of quack grass to invade big bluestem. (Based on Wedin 1990.)


```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="big bluestem", out.width = '50%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("big-bluestem.png")
```

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="quackgrass", out.width = '60%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("quackgrass.png")
```

Remark: In your report you should carefully write down your discoveries in details. Here I briefly write down the code below.

## 1. Data input
```{r }
dat<-read.table("pr6.1",header = TRUE)
dat$ftrt<- as.factor(dat$trt)
head(dat)
```

## 2. Model fitting based on original data
```{r,out.width="60%",fig.align='center',warning=FALSE}
library(car)
model<-aov(y~ftrt,data=dat)
boxplot(y~ftrt,data = dat)
leveneTest(y~ftrt,data=dat)
plot(model,which=2)
```

Assumptions seems to be reasonable.


## 3. ANOVA
```{r }
anova(model)
```

## 4. Quadratic effects of nitrogen under nonirrigated conditions.
There are two methods to do this:1) Fit a regression; 2) Use contrasts.

Lets make a plot first to eyeball the patterns if any exists.

```{r }
#Subset data set excluding trt=2 and trt=6 groups
dat2<-dat[which(dat$trt!=2 & dat$trt!=6),]
#Add nitrogen level
nlev_f<-function(x){
if(x==1){1}else if(x==3){2} else if(x==4){3} else {4}
}
dat2$nlevel<- sapply(dat2$trt,nlev_f)

plot(dat2$nlevel,dat2$y,
     main = "Response vs. nitrogen levels under nonirrigated conditions",
     xlab = "Nitrogen levels",ylab = "Responses")
lines(lowess(dat2$nlevel,dat2$y), col="blue")
```

It seems that there is a negative linear relationship between Response and Nitrogen levels under
noirrigations. There are no quadratic effects. Next we gonna do some professional tests.


1) Constrats

```{r,warning=FALSE }
library(emmeans)
lsmTrt<-lsmeans(model,~ftrt)
summary( contrast(lsmTrt,list("quadratic effec"=c(1,0,-1,-1,1,0))),
infer=c(T,T), level=0.95,
side="two-sided" )
```

There are no significant quadratic effects of nitrogen under nonirrigated conditions since zero belongs to the 95% confidence interval.

2) Fit a quadratic regression with respect to N level of Nonirrigation. Remark: To fit a regression, you need numeric variable of nitrogen levels.
```{r}
#Subset data set excluding trt=2 and trt=6 groups
dat2<-dat[which(dat$trt!=2 & dat$trt!=6),]
#Add nitrogen level
nlev_f<-function(x){
if(x==1){1}else if(x==3){2} else if(x==4){3} else {4}
}
dat2$nlevel<- sapply(dat2$trt,nlev_f)

reg_irri<- lm(y~nlevel+I(nlevel^2),data = dat2)
summary(reg_irri)
```

The coefficient of the quadratic term is not sigfinicant since p-value is 0.3238.

## 5. Effect of irrigation
I used a constrast by controlling N level.
```{r }
library(emmeans)
lsmTrt<-lsmeans(model,~ftrt)
summary( contrast(lsmTrt,list("Irrigation effect"=c(1/2,-1/2,0,0,1/2,-1/2))),
infer=c(T,T), level=0.95,
side="two-sided" )
```

A positive confidence interval means that the plots without irrigation performs better than those plots with irrigation on average across all levels of nitrogen with 95% confidence. Data supports that irrigation has a negative effect on big bluestem.

## 6. Dunnet's method can be used here.
We simply compare the other groups to the "best" groups,e.g., trt=1, which has the largest response.
```{r }
DN<-summary(contrast(lsmTrt, method="trt.vs.ctrl",
adjust="mvt",ref=1),
infer=c(T,T), level=0.95, side="two-sided")
DN
```

All pairs of comparisons between the treatment groups and the control group which is the trt 1 give us 95% **simultaneous confidence intervals** with negative endpoints. This implies that the mean response of the 1st group is significantly larger than those of the other groups respectively at the same time. 

Based on the above, there is a strong evidence that the trt 1,e.g., N level 1+Irrigation, gives us the best result of big bluestem.
